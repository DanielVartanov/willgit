    <h1><a href="http://masanjin.net/">William</a>'s miscellaneous git tools</h1>

    <p> Here are a bunch of git-related tools I've found useful at some
    point. The git repository for all of these is cloneable
    at <code>git://gitorious.org/willgit/mainline.git/</code> (<a href="http://gitorious.org/willgit/mainline/commits/master">browse</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="#git-wtf">git-wtf</a>: understand the current state of your git repository.</li>
    <li><a href="#git-publish-branch">git-publish-branch</a>: publish a branch to a remote repository.</li>
    <li><a href="#git-rank-contributors">git-rank-contributors</a>: rank all authors by patch size.</li>
    <li><a href="#git-show-merges">git-show-merges</a>: show which branches are merged into the current branch.</li>
    <li><a href="#git-walkthrough-add">git-walkthrough-add</a>: (deprecated) like <code>git add -p</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><a name="git-wtf">git-wtf</a></h2>

    <p> <a href="git-wtf">git-wtf</a> is a script to display the state of your repository in a readable and easy-to-scan
format. </p>

<p>git-wtf tries to ease the task of having many git branches. It's also useful
for getting a summary of how tracking branches relate to a remote server.</p>

<p>git-wtf shows you:<ul>
<li> How your branch relates to the remote repo, if it's a tracking branch.</li>
<li> How your branch relates to non-feature ("version") branches, if it's a
  feature branch.</li>
<li> How your branch relates to the feature branches, if it's a version branch.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>For each of these relationships, git-wtf displays the commits pending on
either side, if any. It displays checkboxes along the side for easy scanning
of merged/non-merged branches.</p>

<p>If you're working against a remote repo, git-wtf is best used between a 'git
fetch' and a 'git merge' (or 'git pull' if you don't mind the redundant
network access).</p>

    <p>Examples:

    <div class="screencap"><code><pre>
$ git wtf
Local branch: <span class="green">master</span>
[<span class="green">x</span>] in sync with remote
Remote branch: <span class="cyan">origin/master</span> (git@gitorious.org:willgit/mainline.git)
[<span class="green">x</span>] in sync with local

Feature branches:
{ } <span class="cyan">origin/experimental</span> is NOT merged in (1 commit ahead)
    - some tweaks i'm playing around with [<span class="yellow">80e5da1</span>]
{ } <span class="cyan">origin/dont-assume-origin</span> is NOT merged in (1 commit ahead)
    - guess primary remote repo from git config instead of assuming "origin" [<span class="yellow">23c96f1</span>]
$</pre></code></div>

    <div class="screencap"><code><pre>$ git wtf
Local branch: <span class="green">master</span>
[ ] NOT in sync with remote (needs push)
    - Add before-search hook, for shortcuts for custom search queries. [<span class="yellow">4430d1b</span>] (<span class="purple">edwardzyang@...</span>; 7 days ago)
Remote branch: <span class="cyan">origin/master</span> (git@gitorious.org:sup/mainline.git)
[<span class="green">x</span>] in sync with local

Feature branches:
{ } <span class="cyan">origin/release-0.8.1</span> is NOT merged in (1 commit ahead)
    - bump to 0.8.1 [<span class="yellow">dab43fb</span>] (<span class="purple">wmorgan-sup@...</span>; 2 days ago)
[ ] <span class="green">labels-before-subj</span> is NOT merged in (1 commit ahead)
    - put labels before subject in thread index view [<span class="yellow">790b64d</span>] (<span class="purple">marka@...</span>; 4 weeks ago)
{<span class="green">x</span>} <span class="cyan">origin/enclosed-message-display-tweaks</span> merged in
(<span class="green">x</span>) <span class="green">experiment</span> merged in (only locally)

<span class="red">NOTE</span>: working directory contains modified files
$</pre></code></div>
</p>

    <h2><a name="git-publish-branch">git-publish-branch</a></h2>

    <p> <a href="git-publish-branch">git-publish-branch</a> is a simple script
    to ease the unnecessarily complex task of "publishing" a branch, i.e.,
    taking a local branch, creating a reference to it on a remote repo, and
    setting up the local branch to track the remote one, all in one go. </p>

    <p> You give it a branch name, and that branch is published in your remote
    repository. That's it. If you use <code>-d</code>, it will delete the
    remote reference.</p>

    <p>Useful if you publish your topic branches to the outside world.</p>

    <h2><a name="git-rank-contributors">git-rank-contributors</a></h2>

    <p> <a href="git-rank-contributors">git-rank-contributors</a> is a trivial
    script that paws through your logs and ranks all the contributors by
    the size of their diffs. As always, bigger is better!</p>

    <p> If you use <code>-v</code>, you'll get the raw diff sizes.</p>

    <p> If you use <code>-o</code>, you'll get high-tech email obfuscation.</p>

    <p> Output with just <code>-o</code> may be suitable for piping into a
    CREDITS file. It probably will require some editing in case people submit
    from more than one email address, though. </p>

    <p> This is similar to <code>git shortlog -s -n --no-merges</code>, but counts diff size rather than number of commits. </p>

    <h2><a name="git-show-merges">git-show-merges</a></h2>

    <p> <a href="git-show-merges">git-show-merges</a> is a precursor to <a href="#git-wtf">git-wtf</a>.
    It's a simple tool that shows you which branches have been merged in to the
    current branch, and which haven't. That's it. You can also specify multiple
    non-topic branches (merge branches?) on the commandline.</p>

    <div class="screencap"><code><pre>
$ git show-merges
merged into next:
  attachments
  color
  edit-as-new-fix
  find-in-buffer-fix
  maildir-speedup
  non-ascii-message-id
  release-0.5
  reply-from-hook

not merged into next: 
  encoding-tweaking
  imap-cache-headers
  imap-share-connections
  join-threads-bugfix
  local-changes-only
  master
  mbox-parse-fix
  ncurses-widechar
  ncursesw
  release-0.4
  todo-updates

$</pre></code></div>

    <h2><a name="git-walkthrough-add">git-walkthrough-add</a> (deprecated)</h2>

    <p> <i>In recent gits, <code>git add -p</code> does exactly what this tool
    does. So I will not be putting a lot of energy into maintaining this any
    more.</i> </p>

    <p> <a href="git-wt-add">git-wt-add</a> is a darcs-style interactive staging script for git. It
    walks you through unstaged changes on a hunk-by-hunk basis and allows you
    to pick the ones you'd like staged. It features colorized diff output and a
    full set of navigation and dispatch commands.  </p>

    <p> git-wt-add is based on <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/41033">git-hunk-commit</a>
    --darcs, which was very close to what I wanted, but wasn't quite it. In
    general git-wt-add makes no attempt to conform to the real darcs interface,
    but it's probably pretty close. </p>
